DAVE - flesh out this README into a guide about what prekin is, and maybe its purpose and history.

Shamelessly copied from the prekin software page: Prekin prepares molecular kinemages (input files for Mage & KiNG) from PDB-format coordinate files, using either a choice of built-in scripts or a flexible user specification of options. Prekin can be run in either an interactive mode with option selection from dialog panes; or, it can be run in command-line fashion with all options specified at program invocation.

For installing prekin, look at INSTALL.md in this directory.
