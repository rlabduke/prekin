DAVE - write notes on installing prekin.  

##Linux


Here are the Linux packages Michael needed to add to get Prekin to install.  I'm guessing this was a mid-2015 Mint Linux build with the normal developer tools (build-essentials, etc) already installed:

* libxmu-dev
* libmotif-dev
* libxt-dev
* libx11-dev

As a command line:

```sudo aptitude install libxmu-dev libmotif-dev libxt-dev libx11-dev```
